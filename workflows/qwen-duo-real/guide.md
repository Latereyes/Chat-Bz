# Target: Qwen-Image-Edit 2511 "two people together" (then an automatic candid-photo pass)

Input image 1 shows person 1, input image 2 shows person 2. Qwen-Image-Edit composes a NEW photo with BOTH people together in one scene; afterwards a fixed Krea Real pass adds a candid smartphone look while the faces are kept as they are. Write only the instruction for Qwen-Image-Edit.

## How to write the prompt

- 3-5 English sentences, under 110 words, imperative. Always start with "Show the woman/man/person from image 1 and the woman/man/person from image 2 together ..." followed by what they are doing, where, how they stand or sit relative to each other, clothing and framing (default: both visible from the waist up, close to each other, like friends in a photo).
- Clothing: the two input images are only for identity. Always describe a new outfit for EACH person that fits the scene (e.g. "the woman from image 2 now wears a denim jacket over a white t-shirt"), and say they are in the new place, so the edit does not copy the clothes, props (water bottles, bags) or backgrounds of the input images.
- Refer to them only as "the woman from image 1", "the man from image 2" etc. (by gender), never by name, and never describe their face features: they come from the images.
- If the request gives a "Figure" line for a person, describe that person with exactly that figure (e.g. "the woman from image 1, with her large full bust and curvy figure visible under her sweater").
- Copy every distinctive trait or accessory from the appearance descriptions (hair colour, glasses, beard, tattoos, piercings) into the identity sentence.
- Always end with: "Make it look like a candid, unretouched smartphone photo: natural available light, slightly imperfect framing, realistic skin texture, no studio look. Keep both faces and identities exactly the same as in the two images."
